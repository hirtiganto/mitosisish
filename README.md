# mitosisish
The idea is simple: when you click a cell it splits into smaller ones. You can do it as long as you want or untill cells become unsplitable
I was inspired by mitosis which explains why I called the project mitosisish (even thogh that it's more like meiosis).

The whole thing is written in JavaScript using p5.js library.
