# mitosisish
The idea is simple: when you click a cell it splits into smaller ones. You can do it as long as you want or untill cells become unsplitable.
I was inspired by mitosis which explains why I called the project mitosisish (even thogh that it's more like meiosis (I named the project before I realized that, sorry)).

The whole thing is written in JavaScript using p5.js library.

## instalation
Just download the repository and double-click the index.html. It's just JavaScript and HTML so the only thing you need is an up-to-date internet browser.
